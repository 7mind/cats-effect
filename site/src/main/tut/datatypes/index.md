# Data Types

- **[IO](./io.html)**: data type for encoding synchronous and asynchronous side effects as pure values.
- **[Fiber](./fiber.html)**: the pure result of a [Concurrent](../typeclasses/concurrent.html) data type being started concurrently and that can be either joined or canceled.
- **[Resource](./resource.html)**: resource management data type that complements the `Bracket` typeclass.
- **[SyncIO](./syncio.html)**: data type for encoding synchronous side effects as pure values.
- **[Timer](./timer.html)**: a pure scheduler exposing operations for measuring time and for delaying execution.
